The Earth Observation Prototype 3 (EOP3) for water level estimation is a prototype Jupyter Notebook designed to address the demand for analysis ready water surface elevation and additional altimetry parameters included in NASA’s Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission. This tool allows users to extract time series data through the [Hydrocron API](https://podaac.github.io/hydrocron/overview.html) (_doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13774808_) for river and lake features after defining an area of interest.

This repository is part of the Deliverable 3.2 of SOS-Water - Water Resources System Safe Operating Space in a Changing Climate and Society (_DOI:10.3030/101059264_). Other code contributions to D3.2 can be found at the [SOS-Water - WP3 Earth Observation repository](https://github.com/mibrechb/SOSW_WP3).

## How to use

This file can be run in any instance compatible with Jupyter Notebook, the tool queries online databases and the Hydrocron API, which repackages hydrology datasets from the SWOT satellite into formats that make time-series analysis easier. No further download of SWOT data is necessary. Steps to run the notebook:
